# BrowserPlugin
 This is a very small project that I have created with the use of JavaScript to create a plugin for my browser that generates QRcode for the current webpage and when scanned with my phone it gets open in the browser. The QRcode.js file was taken from a github repository: https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs
